You can interact with Autonoma Creation Engine by either providing steps in natural language, or executing them directly and your actions will be recorded.

[See a video demo here\!](https://www.loom.com/share/6d5c2e9b5f9740ba9f9d522273dc0b51?sid=829e26af-4e60-4167-9713-472933fa6a99)

## Basic navigation actions

To use it with natural language, just send something like `"do XYZ"`

Behind the scenes, it will execute one of these; there's no need to be too explicit.

| **Action**                  | **Description of action**                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |

| `wait x seconds`            | wait a given amount of time in between events          |
| `press enter to send`       | press enter to send a text input                       |
| `open url <url>`            | open a new url                                         |
| `exit last tab`             | close the opened tab and go back to the last one       |
| `set QR <qr-link>`          | to set a QR code on the camera                         |
| `hover`                     | hover on a specific element                            |

## Assertions

To run this, send something like `"validate XYZ"`

Behind the scenes, it will take a screenshot execute one of these; there's no need to be too explicit.
