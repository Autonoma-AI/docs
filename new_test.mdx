Creating a new test for your application is simple and straightforward. Just follow these easy steps:

1. **Select Your Application**\
   Choose the application you want to test from the available list. This allows you to target the correct project for your test scenario.
2. **Choose the Version (for Mobile)**\
   If you're testing a mobile app, select the appropriate version (e.g., 1.x, 2.x, etc.) to ensure your test runs on the right iteration of the app.
3. **Select the Environment (for Web)**\
   If you're testing a web application, choose the environment where you want to test. Options include QA, Dev, Staging, or Prod, depending on your deployment setup.
4. **Click Start**\
   After selecting the application, version (if applicable), and environment, simply click "Start" to initiate your testing session.

Once you've clicked Start, the testing environment will load:

- For **Web Applications**, you’ll see a **Chromium server** streaming your web app, allowing you to interact with it in real-time.
- For **Mobile Applications**, you’ll see an **emulator** streaming your mobile app, giving you the same interactive experience as testing on a physical device.

Now that your environment is ready, you’re all set to start writing your test\! This is the point where you can begin creating the steps for your automated UI test, interacting with your application and defining the actions to be validated.
