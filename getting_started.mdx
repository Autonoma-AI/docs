## 1. What is a UI Test?

A UI test checks that your application behaves as expected when users interact with it (e.g., clicking buttons, filling forms).

##  2. What’s an Assert and Why It Matters

An **assert** is a checkpoint in your test. It confirms that something is correct—like verifying a confirmation message appears after clicking "Submit."

Think of it as asking:  _"Did this work as expected?"_

> **Example:**  
>
> After logging in, assert that you see **"Welcome, Joseph\!"**

## 3. Best Practices for UI Testing

- ✅ **Start with key user flows** (e.g., login, checkout).
- ✅ **Place asserts after important actions** (e.g., after submitting a form).
- ✅ **Check visible outcomes**, like messages, buttons, or page changes.
- ✅ **Build one test per key user flow** to ease up debugging
- ⚠️ **Avoid overloading with unnecessary asserts** — focus on what really matters for the user experience.

## 4. Your First Test in 3 Steps

1. **Define the goal**: _"Test that users can send a contact form."_
2. **Record or describe the steps**: Click "Contact", fill out fields, click "Send."
3. **Add asserts**: Confirm "Message sent\!" appears.

## Example: Creating a Test for a Virtual Card in a Banking App

- **Goal**: Validate that users can generate new virtual cards.
- **Steps**: Click on create a new card, fill out the fields and create it.
- **Asserts**: Validate that there is a new "Active Card" created.
