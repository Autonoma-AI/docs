To start running tests, you first need to add the application (either web or mobile) you plan to test. Here’s a simple guide on how to add a new application or version:

#### For Web Applications:

1. **Add a Name**\
   Provide a **name** for the web application. This helps you easily identify it in your list of available applications.
2. **Enter the URL**\
   Add the **URL** where the web application is hosted. This could be a public-facing URL or an internal testing environment URL.
3. **Set an Environment Tag**\
   Assign an **environment tag** to indicate where the web app is running. Common tags include **Prod**, **Staging**, **QA**, but you can also create custom tags specific to your business needs (e.g., **Dev**, **Beta**, etc.).

#### For Mobile Applications:

1. **Add a Name**\
   Provide a **name** for the mobile application so you can easily identify it.
2. **Upload the Application File**\
   Upload the mobile app file (APK for Android, IPA for iOS) that you want to test. This is the app version you'll be interacting with during your tests.
3. **Add a Version Tag**\
   Specify the **version** of the mobile app, such as **1.x**, **2.x**, etc., to distinguish between different releases or iterations.

Once you’ve uploaded the application (and version), it’s now ready to be used\! You can immediately start building and running tests over it. This allows you to test web and mobile apps effectively by simulating user interactions, verifying functionality, and ensuring quality across different versions and environments.
