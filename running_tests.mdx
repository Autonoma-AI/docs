Once you've created your tests, there are three ways to execute them, providing you with flexibility depending on your needs:

1. **On Demand**\
   The simplest way to run a test is to execute it on demand. To do this, simply click the **Run** button in our UI. This will trigger the test immediately, allowing you to see results in real time and make quick adjustments as needed.
2. **Scheduled Tests**\
   For continuous or periodic testing, you can **schedule** your tests to run automatically at your desired frequency. Options include hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. This is ideal for regular checks, such as ensuring your app is stable after every deployment or monitoring long-term performance over time.
3. **Programmatically via API Endpoint**\
   If you want to integrate test execution into your development pipeline, you can run tests programmatically using our **API endpoint**. This method is perfect for executing tests within a CI/CD pipeline, automating the process and ensuring tests are run as part of your deployment process.

With these three options, you can choose the best way to run tests based on your workflowâ€”whether it's ad-hoc testing, regular checks, or full automation within your CI/CD setup.
